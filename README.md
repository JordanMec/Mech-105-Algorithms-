All my numerical method algorithms I created in Mech 105 - Spring 2021.
# List Of Code File Names
## False Position Algorithm
A MatLab function that estimates the root of a given function.
## Binary Converter
A MatLab function that converts numbers to binary.
## Simpsons 1/3 Algorithm
A general MatLab function for integrating experimental data using Simpsons 1/3 rule. If there are an odd number of intervals the Trapizoidial rule is used for the last interval.  
## LU Factorization with partial pivoting
A MatLab function that determines the LU factorization of a square matrix. This function uses partial pivoting.
